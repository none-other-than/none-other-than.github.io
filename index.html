			<h2>Join today! <br />
				No experience or equipment required.</h2>
			<p>We do not tolerate abusers, supporters of reactionary movements such as fascism or racism, or supporters
				of exclusionary social ideologies such as ableism or homophobia. We do not allow members to be active
				law enforcement officers or employed at domestic intelligence agencies. 
				<br /> <br />
				Because of Washington handgun
				and rifle laws we require that all members be age 21 or older. This is not a comprehensive list, but
				should give you a sense of what we're about.
				<br /><br />
				<b>You don't need to own a gun or have shooting experience - we're happy to welcome new learners!</b>

		<footer class="major container medium">
			<h3 id="cta">Join Us!</h3>
			<p>
				Anyone age 21+ can contact us at <b>bjoin@pugetsoundsra.org</b> with your intent to join - it's that easy.
				<br /> <br />

				<b>Update January 2025:</b> Due to increased interest, we have a significant intake backlog. Do reach
				out to register your interest, but please know that it may be a while before we are able to begin your
				membership. You can join our parent organization at any time, but entry for national members into the
				Puget Sound chapter for local events is similarly backlogged. <br /> <br />

				Sorry, we do not provide recommendations for retailers or ranges in the area.
